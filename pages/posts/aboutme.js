          I am a healthcare worker turned software engineer.  Seems like an odd leap, I know but I have found that my passion for helping others is amplified through technology.  I can help millions of people a day instead of a couple dozen.  It has given me the ability to truly think outside of the box when it comes to finding solutions and offered me a creative outlet in my free time.  I love that the sky is the limit and glass ceilings donâ€™t exist in the realm. Becoming a software engineer has been the best decision I've made, and I can't wait to share my passion with you.
